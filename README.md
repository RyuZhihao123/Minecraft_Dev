ðŸ”¥ **This page is just created. I will complete the repository after my AAAI submission (due 1st Augest).** 

If you're interested, I welcome any potential collaration and let's make this game more functional and playful together!



## Brief
This is a toy program that I created to reproduce the Game "Minecraft" from scratch.

The program is developed in pure C++, and supports the following functions:
- Infinite Terrain Generation.
- Free building and construction.
- Real-time physics-based rendering (â‰ˆ270FPS on my [Legion Pro 5i laptop](https://www.lenovo.com/jp/ja/p/laptops/legion-laptops/legion-5-series/legion-pro-5i-gen-10-16-inch-intel/len101g0040)).
- Various block types (26 different blocks).
- Support local servers for accommodating multiple players.
