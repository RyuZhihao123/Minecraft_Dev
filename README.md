ðŸ”¥ **This repository is still under preparation. I will complete it soon after my recent AAAI submission (due 1st Augest).** 

If you're interested, I welcome any potential collaration and let's make this game more functional and playful together!



## Brief
This is a toy program that I created to reproduce the Game "Minecraft" from scratch.

The program is developed in pure C++, and supports the following functions:
- Infinite Terrain Generation.
- Free building and construction.
- Various block types (26 different blocks).
- Support local servers for accommodating multiple players.
