## Brief
This is a toy program that I created to reproduce the Game "Minecraft".

The program is developed in pure C++, and supports the following functions:
- Infinite Terrain Generation.
- Free building and construction.
- Various block types (26 different blocks).
- Support local servers for accommodating multiple players.
